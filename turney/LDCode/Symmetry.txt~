List of 10 unique wave vectors out of a total of 64 in the order output by the HARMONIC and ANHARMONIC calculations.  The first 3 values are the 'l's in the expression l*b/N, where b is the reciprocal lattice vector and N is the number unit cells.  The next 3 numbers are the Cartesian values of the recipocal wave vectors in 1/nm.
